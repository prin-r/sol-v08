## Contracts

The contract itself is separated across three of our existing use cases:

### Bridge

Contracts used to verify the proof returned as a result of a data request transaction on BandChain.

### StdReference

Contracts to query price data of cryptocurrencies, commodities, and foreign exchange rates from Band's oracle.

### VRF

Helper contract to interact with BandChain's verifiable random function functionality.
